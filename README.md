# AutoTone üîä

AutoTone is a smart, minimal browser extension that **automatically keeps your audio volume steady and comfortable across tabs**. For example, if you're listening to Spotify and start playing a YouTube video, AutoTone will lower Spotify‚Äôs volume and restore it when the video stops, no manual fiddling required.
